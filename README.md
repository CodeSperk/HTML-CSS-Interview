    HTML5 is the **fifth and latest version** of the Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), which is the standard markup language used for creating web pages and web applications.

        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
        <meta name="author" content="John Doe">
        ```
    
    - **New Element tags** like  audio, video, embed, details, datalist, figure, command, canvas (try to know these tags’ short description)
